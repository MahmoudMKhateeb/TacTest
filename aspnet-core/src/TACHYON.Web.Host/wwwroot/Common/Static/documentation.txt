    # How it Works
    <p class="s18"><strong class="tac">Tachyon</strong> is designed to provide a seamless user experience and enable its users to monitor their shipments’ entire lifecycles from a single platform. Using <strong class="tac">Tachyon</strong> is easier than a breeze; here’s <strong>how it works:</strong></p>
    <p class="s15">Once registered, the shipper can book a trip directly through the platform. Our machine learning algorithms assess the freight specs and assign the order to the most appropriate transporter. The shipment is then assigned automatically to a specific truck, all while the shipper receives regular, real-time status updates. Once the shipment has been loaded onto the truck, all necessary documentation is generated electronically. Complete transparency over the shipment lifecycle means shippers also receive proof of delivery, invoices, and payment in real-time. Once the order is completed, all the stakeholders (Shipper, Carrier & Driver) can rate their experience, keeping the platform safe and secure.</p>
